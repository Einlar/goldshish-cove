The course is divided in two parts: a review of statistical mechanics (mainly dedicated to engineers, or who did not follow the Statistical Mechanics course), and a core part regarding complex systems.

These notes cover 95% of the **second part**. For the first part, refer to the complete notes for the [Statistical Mechanics course](/notes/statistical-mechanics-2019).

The only missing lectures in the second part are those done by prof. Suweis.
