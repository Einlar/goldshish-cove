Full notes for the course. The first few lectures (up to 15/10, included) follow the comments from Prof. Gindullina, while the rest is taken from Prof. Badia recordings.

There is still some missing introduction in the 1/10 lecture. Other than that, the notes should be complete.

(All exercises shown during lectures have been added)
