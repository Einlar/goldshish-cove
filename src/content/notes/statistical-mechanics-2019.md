In this document I have tried to reorder the notes of the statistical mechanics course held by Professor Enzo Orlandini at the Department of Physics of the University of Padua during the first semester of the 2019-20 academic year of the masterâ€™s degree.

The notes are fully integrated with the material provided by the professor in the Moodle platform. In addition, I will integrate them, as best as possible, with the books recommended by the professor.
