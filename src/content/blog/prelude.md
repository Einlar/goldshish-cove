description: What is Goldshish?
---

When I first started going to university, there was a _link_, shared year to year, pointing to a folder on a cloud storage. Inside, the knowledge accumulated by past students: hours of work put into compiling comprehensive notes, gathering useful study materials, books and exercises.

In the face of such an effor, I was _inspired_. I was seeing the glimpse of something greater, of the will to store knowledge freely for posterity. And so I wanted to follow that example, and build something too.

This website, **goldshish**, is the third iteration of my contribution. The first has already disappeared, vanished at the end of its hosting plan. The [second](https://einlar.github.io/) is still online.

Here you can find all the notes I gathered over the years - some of them I wrote, some were shared by fellow colleagues, and some were the product of collaboration.

If you want to host a note to this website, just send it as PDF (or `.tex`) to [my mail](mailto:manzali.francesco97@gmail.com), and I will promptly update it.

So see you soon, and thanks for all the _fish_.
