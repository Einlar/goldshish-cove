I've been wanting to restyle this website for a while now - I had not updated the previous iteration in years, and I had grown scared of touching it. I mean, sometimes it stopped working randomly! Usually just restarting the server worked in bringing the website up again, but of course that is not a very good strategy.

So, I finally took the chance when I discovered that [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) has some good templates that I can use. Also:

- Pages are statically generated, so the website is **super fast**. Also this cuts down the hostings costs to 0 (well, except the annual fee for the domain), which is nice. I would like to keep hosting the notes for as long as possible!
- I can finally update the content by just writing Markdown and pushing it to git! No more need to mess up with databases and stuff. This is particularly nice because I have _this terrible idea_ of starting to write blog posts about stuff I like (so probably it'll be Machine Learning & stuff). Well, I still don't know if I actually start writing posts, but surely updating this website will make it easier, right?

The main caveat is that, at the moment, there is no way for users to directly upload notes, or even just add comments. It's something I would like to fix _soonish_ - but for now you can just drop me a [mail](mailto:manzali.francesco97@gmail.com) if you want to upload something, or you notice that something is wrong.
