Goldshish is a collection of notes and a few posts from me - a guy named Francesco who lives in Italy, has studied Physics at the University of Padova and now works as a data scientist / software developer.

If you are a student like I was, I hope you find here a bit of the knowledge you seek, and that these resources will make your journey a tiny bit easier. Surely, they were helpful for me, and that's all the reason there is to share.

## Tech Stack

I'm using [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) with the excellent theme [astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) by satnaing (I still suck at writing CSS).

Everything you see here is built to static files (blazingly FAST), which are served by a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) container via [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) on a VPS on [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/it/cloud/free/).

_(I know, I could just use something like Github Pages/Vercel/Netlify for hosting - but a VPS gives me the flexibility to host anything, so if I need a database in the future it will be easy to add. Also it's free, and I can move out whenever I want since it's just a bunch of containers)._
